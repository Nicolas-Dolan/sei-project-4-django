# Pokémon Unlimited

## Overview
For my final project at General Assembly, I was allocated 1 week. I decided to work solo because I wanted to have a hand in every part of its development. 

Paying tribute to a franchise from my childhood, Pokémon, the project used a database to store user-created Pokémon that could then be implemented into a grid-based game. I wanted to create something that was both fun and complex, testing my abilities and drawing on everything I’d learned so far. 

In the planning phase, I drew relationship models for the back end, specified the components I would need at the front end, and defined what I wanted to achieve in the game. Each morning, I would write a list of what needed to be done and identify the highest priority features that needed to be implemented first. 

I created the back-end database using a Python-based framework called Django and managed it with PostgreSQL. I then installed React, a JavaScript-based framework, for the front end and used Axios to make database requests. 

## Goal
To create a full-stack Restful api that uses React in the frontend and Django/PostgreSQL in the backend. 

### Timeframe
1 week

### Technologies used
JavaScript, React, Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Axios.
